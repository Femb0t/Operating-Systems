1. I worked on this assignment by myself
2. I did not do everything exactly as the assignment showed primarily because I didn't read the given examples and I wanted to try

3. N/A
4. RR was probably the hardest to implement and SJF can be made simple by sorting the processes and then calling FIFO.
